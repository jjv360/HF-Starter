# High Fidelity: Starter

This contains everything you need to create [High Fidelity](https://highfidelity.com) scripts
using the latest JavaScript features, including using browser-compatible libraries from npm.

## Installation

To use, copy all files into a new directory. Change the package.json to your liking, and then run `npm install` to install dependencies.

Your `src/start.js` script is the entry point, and should export your entity class.

## Building

Once you've added your code, run `npm run build` to compile the output to the `dist/` folder.
This is the file you can load into the Client Entity or Server Entity script field in High Fidelity.
